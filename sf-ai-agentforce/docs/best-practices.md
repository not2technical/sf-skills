# Agent Script Best Practices

## Overview

This guide covers best practices for building production-ready Agentforce agents using Agent Script.

---

## 1. Structure & Organization

### Use Meaningful Names

```agentscript
# ✅ GOOD - Clear, descriptive names
topic order_management:
    description: "Handles order creation, updates, and status inquiries"

# ❌ BAD - Vague names
topic topic1:
    description: "Does stuff"
```

### Follow Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Agent name | PascalCase with underscores | `Customer_Service_Agent` |
| Topic name | snake_case | `order_management` |
| Variable name | snake_case | `user_email` |
| Action name | snake_case | `get_account_details` |

### Keep Topics Focused

Each topic should handle ONE category of tasks:

```agentscript
# ✅ GOOD - Single responsibility
topic billing_inquiries:
    description: "Answers questions about invoices, payments, and account balances"

topic order_tracking:
    description: "Provides order status and shipping updates"

# ❌ BAD - Too broad
topic customer_stuff:
    description: "Handles billing, orders, support, and everything else"
```

---

## 2. Variable Management

### Always Initialize Variables

```agentscript
variables:
    # ✅ GOOD - Has default value
    user_name: mutable string = ""
        description: "Customer's full name"

    order_count: mutable number = 0
        description: "Number of orders in cart"

    # ❌ BAD - No default (will cause issues)
    # user_name: mutable string
```

### Use Appropriate Types

| Data | Type | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Names, IDs, text | `string` | `"John Doe"` |
| Counts, amounts | `number` | `42`, `99.99` |
| Flags, toggles | `boolean` | `True`, `False` |

### Document Every Variable

```agentscript
variables:
    cart_total: mutable number = 0
        description: "Total value of items in cart, in USD"

    needs_approval: mutable boolean = False
        description: "Whether the order requires manager approval (>$10,000)"
```

---

## 3. Topic Design

### Start with a Topic Selector

Every agent should have a clear entry point:

```agentscript
start_agent topic_selector:
    description: "Routes users to the appropriate topic based on their needs"
    reasoning:
        instructions:->
            | Determine what the user needs help with.
            | Ask clarifying questions if the intent is unclear.
            | Route to the most specific topic that can help.
        actions:
            orders: @utils.transition to @topic.order_management
                description: "Help with orders and purchases"
            support: @utils.transition to @topic.technical_support
                description: "Technical issues and troubleshooting"
            billing: @utils.transition to @topic.billing
                description: "Payment and invoice questions"
```

### Provide Clear Descriptions

Topic descriptions help the LLM make routing decisions:

```agentscript
# ✅ GOOD - Specific and actionable
topic password_reset:
    description: "Helps users reset forgotten passwords and unlock accounts"

# ❌ BAD - Too vague
topic password_reset:
    description: "Password stuff"
```

### Enable Return Navigation

Always provide a way back to the main menu:

```agentscript
topic order_details:
    description: "Shows order information"
    reasoning:
        actions:
            back_to_menu: @utils.transition to @topic.topic_selector
                description: "Return to main menu for other requests"
```

---

## 4. Action Integration

### Define Clear Input/Output Contracts

```agentscript
get_order_status:
    description: "Retrieves the current status of a customer order"
    inputs:
        order_id: string
            description: "The unique order identifier (e.g., ORD-12345)"
    outputs:
        status: string
            description: "Current status (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered)"
        estimated_delivery: string
            description: "Expected delivery date in YYYY-MM-DD format"
        tracking_number: string
            description: "Shipping carrier tracking number, if available"
    target: "flow://Get_Order_Status"
```

### Use Appropriate Binding Patterns

```agentscript
reasoning:
    actions:
        # LLM extracts from conversation
        lookup: @actions.get_order
            with order_id=...

        # Fixed value
        default_lookup: @actions.get_order
            with order_id="DEFAULT"

        # From variable
        bound_lookup: @actions.get_order
            with order_id=@variables.current_order_id
```

### Capture Outputs

Always capture action outputs you'll need later:

```agentscript
check_status: @actions.get_order_status
    with order_id=...
    set @variables.order_status = @outputs.status
    set @variables.delivery_date = @outputs.estimated_delivery
```

## 5. Error Handling

### Validate Before Critical Operations

```agentscript
instructions:->
    # Validate required fields
    if @variables.amount is None:
        | I need to know the transfer amount before proceeding.
        | How much would you like to transfer?

    if @variables.amount <= 0:
        | The amount must be greater than zero.
        | Please provide a valid amount.

    if @variables.amount > 10000:
        set @variables.needs_approval = True
        | Transfers over $10,000 require manager approval.
        | I'll flag this for review.
```

### Use Conditional Action Availability

```agentscript
reasoning:
    actions:
        # Only available when validation passes
        process_transfer: @actions.transfer_funds
            with amount=@variables.amount
            available when @variables.amount > 0
            available when @variables.needs_approval == False
```

### Provide Helpful Error Messages

```agentscript
instructions:->
    if @variables.operation_failed == True:
        | I apologize, but I wasn't able to complete that request.
        | Error: {!@variables.error_message}
        |
        | Would you like to:
        | - Try again with different information
        | - Speak with a support agent
        | - Return to the main menu
```

## 6. Security & Guardrails

### Set System-Level Guardrails

```agentscript
system:
    instructions:
        | You are a helpful customer service agent.
        | Always be professional and courteous.
        |
        | IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS:
        | - Never share customer data with unauthorized parties
        | - Never reveal internal system details or error messages
        | - Never process transactions without proper verification
        | - If unsure, escalate to a human agent
```

### Validate Sensitive Operations

```agentscript
topic account_changes:
    description: "Handles account modifications"
    reasoning:
        instructions:->
            # Verify identity before sensitive changes
            if @variables.identity_verified == False:
                | For your security, I need to verify your identity.
                | Please provide your account PIN or answer your security question.

        actions:
            update_email: @actions.update_account_email
                available when @variables.identity_verified == True
```

### Don't Expose Internals

```agentscript
# ✅ GOOD - User-friendly error
instructions:->
    if @variables.api_error == True:
        | I'm having trouble completing that request right now.
        | Please try again in a few minutes.

# ❌ BAD - Exposes internals
instructions:->
    if @variables.api_error == True:
        | Error: SQL timeout on server db-prod-03, query exceeded 30s limit
```

---

## 7. Instructions Quality

### Be Specific and Actionable

```agentscript
# ✅ GOOD - Specific instructions
instructions:->
    | Help the customer track their order.
    | Ask for the order number if not provided.
    | Provide the current status, estimated delivery, and tracking link.
    | If the order is delayed, apologize and offer expedited shipping.

# ❌ BAD - Vague instructions
instructions:->
    | Help with orders.
```

### Use Template Expressions for Personalization

```agentscript
instructions:->
    | Hello {!@variables.user_name}!
    | Your current order total is ${!@variables.cart_total}.
    | Would you like to proceed to checkout?
```

### Handle Edge Cases

```agentscript
instructions:->
    | Look up the customer's order.
    |
    | If no orders found:
    | - Confirm the email/account is correct
    | - Check if they might have ordered as a guest
    | - Offer to help place a new order
    |
    | If multiple orders found:
    | - List the recent orders with dates
    | - Ask which one they need help with
```

## 8. Performance Considerations

### Minimize Action Calls

```agentscript
# ✅ GOOD - Single action returns all needed data
get_customer_profile: @actions.get_full_profile
    with customer_id=...
    set @variables.name = @outputs.name
    set @variables.email = @outputs.email
    set @variables.phone = @outputs.phone

# ❌ BAD - Multiple calls for related data
get_name: @actions.get_customer_name
get_email: @actions.get_customer_email
get_phone: @actions.get_customer_phone
```

### Use Callbacks Wisely

```agentscript
# Chain related actions
process_order: @actions.create_order
    with items=@variables.cart_items
    set @variables.order_id = @outputs.order_id
    run @actions.send_confirmation_email
        with order_id=@variables.order_id
    run @actions.update_inventory
        with order_id=@variables.order_id
```
